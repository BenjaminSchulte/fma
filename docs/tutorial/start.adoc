= Quick start tutorial

== Getting started

=== Building your first FMA file

In your editor, type the following code in `helloworld.fma`:

[source, ruby]
----
macro say_hello(to)
  Compiler.print "Hello #{to}!"
end

say_hello "world"
----


=== Compiling your FMA file

At the command line, run the FMA compiler using:

    fma -l 65816 helloworld.fma

The result should be some debug outputs and the message "Hello world!" somewhere in your console.

The parameter `-l 65816` tells the compiler to include the SNES 65816 language
support. However, the current code does not use any of those features, so any
other language would also be possible.
