= if-conditions

Conditions can be defined using `if` or `unless`:

[source,ruby]
if condition
  ...
end

If you need more than one condition or want to check the else-case you can
use `elsif` and/or `else`

[source,ruby]
if condition
  ...
elsif condition
  ...
else
  ...
end

Conditions can also be added to the end of a statement:

[source,ruby]
return 1 if condition
return 2 unless other_condition
